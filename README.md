# nw-floating
A node-webkit integration with AngularJS to make dropbox like floating windows.

# Features
Dropbox dropping down menus!

# Dependencies
In order to use it elegantly, I integrated angularjs for a cool use of directive, other than this, nothing more is needed in your NW application.

# Usage
Simply use the directives in your html and declare the width and height of your window in any of the Angular run methods.

There are three directives now. (2015-04-17):

* float-container
    <float-container background="white">
    </float-container>
